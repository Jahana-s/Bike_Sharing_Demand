## General Information

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

Our objective is to develop a model to find the variables which are significant for the demand of shared bikes from the available set of variables. 

A public dataset for bike sharing demand is being used in the project.

## Conclusions
- With increase in temperature, there is an increase in demand for bike sharing. A linear relationship is observed between temperature and count. 
- Business is better from May until October. And least in January. 
- There is a better demand in fall followed by summer.
- Popularity for bike sharing is more when the weather is clear.
- Business has attracted more customers in 2019 compared to 2018. 

## Technologies Used
- numpy - version 1.20.1
- pandas - version 1.2.4
- matplotlib - version 3.3.4
- seaborn - version 0.11.1
